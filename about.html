				<h1>My interests and passions in technology:</h1>
				<p>I’ve taken many different paths across the programming world, experimenting with my own projects as I went. I started with web development and design, learning and growing with <span class="blue">HTML</span>, <span class="blue">CSS</span>, and <span class="blue">JavaScript</span>, while strengthening my core design principles. I also entered <span class="blue">Android development</span> with <span class="blue">Java</span> several years ago, and every app I have taken up has taught me even more about the Android process. Experimenting with <span class="blue">Django</span>, <span class="blue">PHP</span>, and <span class="blue">SQL</span> gave me some strong backend knowledge as well. Recently, with my Cashbot.ai internship, I've gotten into creating large applications with <span class="blue">React</span>, <span class="blue">Redux</span> and <span class="blue">node.js</span>, and it's looks like something I will definitely pursue for a long time.</p>
				<p>I find a lot of excitement in coding full stack applications - from the design to the details -  and in learning new frameworks. I’ve worked as the lead developer for my own startup, done work with other companies such as <a class="link" href="https://uber.com">Uber</a>, <a class="link" href="https://cashbot.ai">Cashbot.ai</a>, <a class="link" href="https://hindsight.io">Hindsight</span>, created some of my own websites, and released applications on the Play Store (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.chargo.chargo&hl=en">Chargo</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tca.firstapp.fairsplit&hl=en">Fair Split</a>). Even aside from coding, I love technology in general! I frequent news sites talking about new tech and watch a lot of tech YouTubers too (my favorites being Linus Tech Tips, Dave Lee, and a few others). It’s been a passion of mine for the longest time, and I always gravitate back toward learning about advances and new releases in technology fields out there.

				</div>
				<p>I’m currently an <span class="blue">EECS (declared Computer Science)</span> student in the college of engineering and a <span class="blue">Regents' and Chancellor's merit scholar</span> (the top 2% academic-wise) at UC Berkeley. I’m working hard on applying all that I have learned these past few years and my passion for technology on the work that I do.</p>
				<p>Looking up to people like Elon Musk, Larry Page and Steve Jobs, I strive to come up with my own take on solving real problems. As I pursue a computer science major, I have an intense desire to use my passion for technology and to improve my technical creativity, both for personal satisfaction and to make a difference in the world.

				<h2>My experience at Uber</h2>
				<p>Over the summer of 2019, I was a software engineer intern working at <a class="link" href="https://uber.com">Uber</a> in SF. It was my first real experience working at a large company and I learned more about dev workflow, scalability, importance of architecture, testing, and code practice and reliability than I have anywhere else.</p>
				<p>I spent my time as a mobile engineer working on the Driver Progression team. I took up a major project calling for a new rating and tipping screen on the Uber rider Android app itself. The screen was expected to globally increase tips by several whole percentages, but the main purpose of my project and my time there was to spearhead the use of a new mobile framework that my team created. I was the first developer of this framework for Android, and I thoroughly documented everything - from good practices and structure to existing bugs and how to fix them - in an RFC for future developers to reference.</p>
				<p>The screen itself was a big deal, but I believe the even bigger impact was the major reduction in effort and code, and the increase in productivity that developers will have if they use the framework and my documentation.</p>
				<p>Finally, since I was curious, I spent the last week of my internship helping migrate a Python microservice to Golang as a small backend project.</p>
				<p>There's a lot I took away from Uber, and a lot more I wish I could have, as well. I definitely miss the exciting work that I was doing, as well as my team, because I know we were all making a huge impact in the company and in the transportation market.</p>

				<h2>My experience at Cashbot.ai</h2>
				<p>Over the summer of 2018, I was a full time software developer intern at <a class="link" href="https://cashbot.ai">Cashbot.ai</a> (a startup located at Berkeley Skydeck). I was also a part time intern through the school year. Cashbot.ai is a platform that helps business owners promote their products through chatbots, and helps chatbot owners make money through affiliate marketing and endorsements.</p>
				<p>Going into the job, I didn't really have much knowledge of JavaScript. Over the course of about 3 days at the start of my internship, I pushed myself to learn the language along with React and Redux following the ARc methodology, with a lot of help from my senior developer and Co-founder of the company, Ben. I teamed up with him and some more incoming interns to work hard on recreating the Cashbot.ai web application with React, Redux, and node.js.</p>
				<p>It was definitely a wild summer and I learned more than I ever thought I could about everything from the latest development tactics and tools (in so many different sectors) to creating intuitive product flows and user experiences. Being part of a startup in its very early stages helped me actually become involved in the workings of the company instead of sitting back and letting things happen.</p>

				<h2>More about my venture: Chargo</h2>
				<p>One real-world problem presented itself when I found myself running out of phone battery in downtown San Francisco. After some initial panic, I asked myself if this was a common issue and if I could actually use technology to solve it. MIT Launch’s summer entrepreneurship program provided the perfect platform for me to be able to do that. There, I co-founded a technology startup called Chargo, which solves this problem by providing a software solution for people on-the-go to rent portable chargers.
				</p>
				<p>More specifically, Chargo provides restaurants with portable chargers and stations to people walking or travelling around cities. Our mobile application provides ease of access for rentals and deposits tied to online accounts: essentially a citi-bike for portable chargers. We are working (during the time we get as students) to expand to the Bay Area and start anew. I work as the lead developer to code the Android application (which is <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.chargo.chargo&hl=en">out on the Play Store</a>, and in progress), back-end, and the website. Our website is located <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.chargo.co">here.</a>We have also won two pitch competitions so far! We are looking to put the money to good use.</p>

				<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Other experiences:</h2>
				<p>Currently, at UC Berkeley, I am the Product Manager for the Berkeley Mobile application in ASUC's Office of the CTO. We work like an organized startup to provide the best campus mobile app experience every student can have. I joined the team my freshman year as an Android developer, and I'm currently working as PM alongside some brilliant developers and designers of Berkeley to put out new features, fix bugs, and keep the app in great shape. It’s been one of my favorite experiences thus far, because we work and act like a small, efficient team on some really important features for the campus. As a developer, I used to work on most of the technical implementations within the app so far, with APIs including Google Maps and Places, Firebase, and our very own Berkeley Mobile API. Our Android application is now open source on GitHub and officially available <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asuc.asucmobile&hl=en">here</a> and our iOS app is available <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/berkeley-mobile/id912243518?mt=8">here</a>.</p>
